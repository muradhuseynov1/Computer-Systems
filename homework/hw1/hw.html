            Also known as PV (photo-valtic) panels, this devices are used to conver light from the sun into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads. <br> <br>
            Solar Panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including <em style="color: indigo;">remote power systems</em> for <em style="color: indigo;">cabins</em>, <em style="color: indigo;">telecommunications equipment</em>, <em style="color: indigo;">remote sensing</em>, and of course 
            for the production of electricity by residential and commercial <em style="color: indigo;">solar electric systems</em>. <br> <br>
            Nowadays, there is an increasing demand on Solar Panels and their usage is expanding day-by-day. E.g: Powering homes, cars, appliances, businesses, and cities;
            <strong>Concentrated</strong> solar power energy systems are frequently used for heating water for households, especially indoor 
            water tanks and swimming pools.
